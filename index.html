<p class="para">Modern soccer was devleoped in England. The history of soccer can be traced back to ball games played in places like Rome and China. 
The balls they used were made from animal skin. Soccer began to evolve in Europe from the medieval period, people began kicking a ball that is made from pig's bladder. Besides kicking the ball, the game also involved punching off the ball with the fist. This form of soccer was more rough and violent than the modern soccer way of playing.  Since it was so violent, there were deaths and tons of injuries. Later on, the violent game was finally forbidded for several centuries. For a long time, there weren’t any rules that were confirmed and made. There were also many concerns of the size of the field, the ball, and others. 
This sport was at first an entertainment for the British people, but later on expanded all over the world with different rules and led to the modern day soccer.

 <p class="para">In the older era, the players relied more on individual skills and less tactical plays. There weren't any modern technology like VAR or performance trackers. However, in this era, we tedn to focus more on tactical game plans. 
  Although we focus on game plans, there are teams where they work more on individual stuff than team play. There are teams where they work on individual skills and strategic plans at the same time. In this era, the game is faster 
  and more physically demanding.
